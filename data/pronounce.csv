* **chap- (chapt-)**:  The ""ch"" is pronounced as in ""church.""  ""apt"" is pronounced as in ""apt."" This is referring to the pileus (cap) structure.  While not directly translatable to English in this context, it hints at a feature of the fungus, often related to its texture.
* **-tum (-tum)**: This is a grammatical ending; it's a neuter noun ending. It doesn't have a direct pronunciation meaning, but contributes to the overall word sound.
* **bi- (bi-)**: Pronounced with a long ""i"" sound, like in ""bike."" It means ""two"" or ""twice.""
* **for- (form-)**:  Pronounced with a short ""o"" sound as in ""for.""  ""Form"" here relates to shape or form.
* **-me (-me)**: This is a grammatical ending; it's the neuter nominative singular form.  Like ""-tum,"" it doesn't hold direct meaning when pronounced but is crucial for grammatical correctness.
